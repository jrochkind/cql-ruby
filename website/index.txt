h2. What

cql-ruby provides a common querly language (CQL) parser.  CQL is a format frequently used
in the library world.  This parser was translated from the CQL-Java parser written by 
Mike Taylor available here "http://zing.z3950.org/cql/java/":http://zing.z3950.org/cql/java/

The parser builds a CQL parse tree suitable to serializing to various forms, built in are
to_cql, to_xcql and a provisional to_solr

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install cql_ruby</pre>
